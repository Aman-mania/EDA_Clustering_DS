# Data Science Algorithms Implementation
This repository contains the suolution implemntation for some common and most relevant Data Science algoritms like EDA, Clusteriing and Lookalike.
More algorithms will be implemented and updated here.

## Project Overview

The repository contains the following files:
- **Aman_Biswakarma_Clustering.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the clustering analysis and model implementation for the assignment.
- **Aman_Biswakarma_Clustering.pdf**: A PDF version of the clustering notebook for easier readability and sharing.
- **Aman_Biswakarma_EDA.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook showcasing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the dataset.
- **Aman_Biswakarma_Lookalike.csv**: A CSV file containing the dataset used for the analysis.
- **Aman_Biswakarma_Lookalike.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for additional analysis or tasks related to the lookalike model.

## Purpose

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in data science tasks, including data exploration, clustering, and building models, which are most commonly used for data analysis and classification.

The code files (.ipynb) contains step by step instructions and comments explaining my thought process while performing those tasks. It can be used for better understanding of the code and reflect my approach clearly.
